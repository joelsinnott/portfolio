      <p>The client:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.innosolv.ch/" target="_blank">Innosolv</a> ist a Swiss software company, developing solutions for energy and water suppliers, for cities and municipalities.</p><br>
      <p>The project:</p>
      <p>In line with the transition from desktop to the web, Innosolv recognized an opportunity to use this momentum and reevaluate the design of their software, which has remained largely unchanged for over a decade. 

        A design system as well as initial screen-designs had been developed by another design agency, however the partnership had not been fruitful. As a result, I was assigned the responsibility of assessing their work and offering guidance to establish a robust design foundation for the next generation of Innosolv products.</p><br>
      <p>My involvement:</p>
      <p>Design system audit, implementing recommended improvements, interface design, UX consulting, prototyping, user research</p>
